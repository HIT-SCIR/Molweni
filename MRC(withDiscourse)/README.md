This version of the Molweni dataset is oriented to the machine reading comprehension (MRC) task of multi person dialogues, including the discourse structure information of each dialogue.

The molweni dataset consists of answerable questions and unanswerable questions, in which the answerable questions are extraction questions, and the answers are a continuous text fragment (span) in an utterance of original dialogue. For unanswerable questions, we annotate plausible answers.
