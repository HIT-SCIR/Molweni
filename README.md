- Abstract: Research into the area of multiparty dialogue has grown considerably over the recent few years. In this paper, we present the Molweni dataset1, a machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset with discourse structure built over multiparty dialogue. Molweni’s source samples from the Ubuntu Chat Corpus, including 10,000 dialogues comprising 88,303 utterances. We annotate 32,700 questions on this corpus, including both answerable and unanswerable questions. Molweni also uniquely contributes discourse dependency annotations for its multiparty dialogue, contributing large-scale (78,246 annotated discourse relations) data to bear on the task of multiparty dialogue discourse parsing. Our experiments show that Molweni is a challenging dataset for current MRC models; BERT-wwm, a current, strong SQuAD 2.0 performer, achieves only 67.7% F1 on Molweni’s questions, a 20+% significant drop as compared against its SQuAD 2.0 performance.
